Sample Essay4 - 2 Question ? Do you agree or disagree with the statement? Teenagers are more influenced by their friends than anyone else. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
Some people think that friends do not have a significant impact on children¡¯s lives. However, in my opinion, friends exert the most influence, as they spend most of their time together and exert tremendous peer pressure. 
To begin with, teenagers spend most of their time with friends. As young people become older, they spend more time socializing and studying with their friends. For example, when I was in high school, I spent all day with my friends at school, and then we would study together for the college entrance exam after school. And we often went to grab a bite to eat together during study breaks or after studying. Since I did not have many chances to talk to my parents, I told together with my friends whenever I had problems and I follow their advice. This was because I thought they understood me better than my parents did, as we spent so much time together.
On top of that, teenagers are susceptible to receive peer pressure. As they enter puberty, they want to win more acknowledgments from their friends and to be popular. Often they participated in behavior that they feel will impress their friends. For instance, one of my old friends was a good student and athlete, but when he became a high school student, he began to have a problem. The main reason was the group of people that he was hanging out. Because of peer pressure, he started skipping classes and drinking alcohol. The incredible pressure that teenagers feel to be accepted into a social group can be an overwhelming force. 
To sum up, adolescents devote much of their time to friends, and pressure from one¡¯s peers is powerful. In this regard, I strongly believe that friends are the most essential influence on young people.
